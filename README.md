NeXT assignment

Download the zip file

Extract to your desktop.

Need to have PyChram (because I dont know how to deploy properly)

This file location need to change before compile at PyCharm :-

code line 61:- screen.bgpic("C:/Users/Username of your PC/Desktop/whereiss-master/map.gif")

code line 62:- screen.register_shape("C:/Users/Username of your PC/Desktop/whereiss-master/iss.gif")

code line 66:- iss.shape("C:/Users/Username of your PC/Desktop/whereiss-master/iss.gif")


If having trouble to run the code:

go to "EDIT CONFIGURATION" and choose proper python interpreter.



I am sorry for inconveniencing.
